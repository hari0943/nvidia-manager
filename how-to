well what does each script do ?

-> nvidia_off.sh
	-> Unloads some modules
	-> Disables gpu via acpi_call
	-> Removes Nvidia bus from kernel + enables powersave for the graphic card and PCIe controller
-> nvidia_on.sh
	-> Enables gpu using acpi_call
	-> Turns on the gpu 
	-> Loads some modules

If you are reading this section, and have tried this in your machine, chances are high that it won't work.
In both the files, there's a function to enable, and disable the gpu.
For this to work, you will need a string , for acpi_call to work.
This string can be foung out , if you have acpi_call installed.
In the folder /usr/share/acpi_call there's a file calles turn_off_gpu.sh.
For further info on how to obtain this string( its of the type, \_SB....)
goto https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/hybrid_graphics#Using_acpi_call
Now replace my string, with your string and it should work all fine.
After a gpu on/off make sure your restart your favourite window manager.
This script is taken(copied) mostly from nvidia-xrun, and the acpi_call part i have added, but not done any checking if it's really needed or not.
If you are feeling that somthing can be improved, please create an issue.
The reason i am not releasing it for any distro(in my case void), is that i don't know how to.
